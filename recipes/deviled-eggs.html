    <p>Deviled eggs, also known as stuffed eggs, curried eggs or dressed eggs, are hard-boiled eggs that have been
        peeled, cut in half, with the yolk scooped out and then refilled having been mixed with other ingredients such
        as mayonnaise, mustard and sprinkled with paprika, cinnamon or curry powder. They are generally served cold as a
        side dish, appetizer or a main course during gatherings or parties. The dish is popular in Europe, North America
        and Australia.</p>
